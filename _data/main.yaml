  monthly5Rock is an indie game dev studio that started in 2021 as a team.
  Our first game was '경성 탐정'(Kyungsung Detective), a detective game
  that takes place in the 1930s in an alternate history setting.
  As a detective, you talk to witnesses, gather clues, find out more by solving
  unique Korean crossword puzzles.
  And discover the truth yourself through an age of radical change and confusion.

  '경성 탐정'(Kyungsung Detective) was originally planned to be released
  in Q1 2024 and was in full production during 2023.
  However, due to some unfortunate circumstances, the release couldn't be on time,
  which also affected the team's stability to continue production.
  Hence the team decided to cease further production and split up,
  leaving the studio with only a single member, me!

  Now monthly5Rock is freshly starting as a solo indie game dev studio.
